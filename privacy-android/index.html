    data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

<h2>Information Collection And Use</h2>

<p>We do not collect any personal information from you when you download our applications. We do not require you to get registered

App sign-up and login is required only when the user chooses to download the songs and maintain a playlist. No personal information is shared to a third party. The login information is used only to provide these features for the users and not in any other way as the app doesn't contain any login information.</p>


<h2>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting
    the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
<p>We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, prior to the change
    becoming effective and update the "effective date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this
    Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
